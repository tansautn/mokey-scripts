# ðŸ’  Zuko's Monkeys :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside:

Welcome to the **monkey-scripts** repository! This repository is dedicated to hosting and sharing custom userscripts for Tampermonkey (or Greasemonkey, Violentmonkey) and custom styles for webpages using the Stylebot extension.

## What are user scripts?

[User scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) put you in control of your browsing experience. Once installed, they automatically make the sites you visit better by adding features, making them easier to use, or taking out the annoying bits. This repository contains a collection of userscripts designed to enhance your browsing experience by automating tasks or modifying webpage behavior. In addition, it includes custom styles that can be applied to webpages to improve their appearance or usability.

## Userscripts

Userscripts are small pieces of JavaScript code that run on specific webpages. They are typically used to add new features, modify existing ones, or automate repetitive tasks. These scripts are compatible with popular browser extensions such as [Tampermonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampermonkey), [Violentmonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violentmonkey), and [Greasemonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasemonkey).

### Available Userscripts

- **Soundcloud fck Tungtee**: Removing annoying tracks from "TÃ¹ng Tee - 0967671***". Music browsing more cleaner
- *...*

## Custom Styles

Custom styles are CSS rules that change the appearance of specific webpages. These styles can be applied using the Stylebot extension.

### Available Styles

- **SC Darkmode**: Darkmode for soundcloud.com. Main part taken from somewhere. I did not remember. The modification of Playback controls, track comments was made by me.

## Use IDE to develop JS ?
You will need a server to serve the developing js file.
Then create empty script that require your editing file. Ex: `// @require      https://shx.test/script.js`.
Full header will be like:
```
// ==UserScript==
// @name         Hypeddit DownloadWallBypasser 2k24
// @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/
// @version      2024-07-24
// @description  Bypass the fangates. Soundcloud and Spotify accounts are mandatory! Please make sure to log them on first before running the script!
// @author       fan1200
// @match        https://hypeddit.com/*
// @match        https://pumpyoursound.com/*
// @match        https://secure.soundcloud.com/connect*
// @match        https://secure.soundcloud.com/authorize*
// @icon         https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?sz=64&domain=hypeddit.com
// @grant        none
// @require      https://shx.test/script.js
// ==/UserScript==
```
The `shx.test` were run on my local development server.
